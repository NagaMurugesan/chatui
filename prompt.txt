I want two type of users, one is based on local authentication and another one is based on SSO authentication, 
The user should choose which type of login he want to use in login screen and the application should login based on that. 
Admin user should login using local authentication and should configure SSO authentication using SAML, 

Admin user should have the following features:  Add these features to admin user in left navigation bar.
1. Configure SSO
2. Configure new user.
3. create and store secrets.

Once the admin user configure SSO, then normal user should be able to login using SSO

Can you modify this app and redeploy. Force the user UI to clear the cache.
